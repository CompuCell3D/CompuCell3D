CompuCell3D
===========

CompuCell3D is a multiscale multicellular virtual tissue modeling and simulation environment.
CompuCell3D is written in C++ and provides Python bindings for model and simulation development
in Python. CompuCell3D is supported on Windows, Mac and Linux.

Getting Started
---------------

- Model development for CompuCell3D is best performed using the
  `Twedit++ IDE <https://github.com/CompuCell3D/cc3d-twedit5/tree/master>`_.

- CompuCell3D simulations can be interactively executed with real-time rendering using
  `CompuCell3D Player <https://github.com/CompuCell3D/cc3d-player5/tree/master>`_.

- Core CompuCell3D modeling and simulation features are documented in the
  `CompuCell3D Reference Manual <https://compucell3dreferencemanual.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_.

- CompuCell3D Python model and simulation development and walkthroughs are documented in the
  `Python Scripting Manual for CompuCell3D <https://pythonscriptingmanual.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_.

- CompuCell3D is distributed with an extensive
  `repository of demos <https://github.com/CompuCell3D/CompuCell3D/tree/master/CompuCell3D/core/Demos>`_.

- `CompuCell3D Extensions <https://github.com/CompuCell3D/CompuCell3DExtensions/tree/main>`_
  offer integrated third-party modeling and simulation capabilities.
