Description: An open-source single-cell-based modeling environment
 for building and running multi-cell simulations.
 It is primarly used to study how cellular behaviors affect tissue 
 and organ formation.CompuCell was initially developed to help researchers 
 (biologists and physicists) model materials and tissues without having to 
 dedicate resources to 
 developing code that will reproduce existing software. 
 The core CC3D is written in  C++ and exposes most of its API to Python. 
 Users can easily define model parameters in both XML and Python files and run 
 the simulation with our GUI the CompuCell Player.GUI-less mode is also 
 available. The GUI gives users an easy interface to complex models as well 
 as real time visualization of their simulations.
