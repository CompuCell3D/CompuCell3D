# Code of Conduct

## Our Promise

Hey there! We want everyone in our project and community to have a great time, no matter who you are. We're committed to making this a welcoming and harassment-free space for everyone, regardless of background.

## How We Roll

Here are some cool things that make our community awesome:

- We use friendly and inclusive language.
- We respect different opinions and experiences.
- Constructive criticism? Bring it on! We love to grow.
- We focus on what's best for the community.
- Empathy is our superpower.

But there are a few no-nos:

- No creepy language or images, and definitely no unwanted flirting.
- No trolling or mean comments. We're all friends here.
- Harassment, whether public or private, is a big nope.
- Don't share someone's private info without their permission.
- Basically, be cool and respectful. Easy, right?

## Our Responsibilities

We'll make sure the vibe stays positive. If someone's not playing by the rules, we'll step in and sort things out. We're all in this together!

## Where This Applies

This vibe check is for our project spaces and anywhere you're repping the project. So, whether you're rocking our official email, posting on social media, or representing us at an event, keep it chill.
