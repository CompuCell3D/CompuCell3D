How To Get Help
AAAIntroduction

If you got stuck with a problem when developing with the POCO C++ Libraries,
here's some information how to get help and support.

First, and most important, <!DON'T PANIC!>!

There is help and support available.
First, try the [[http://pocoproject.org POCO C++ Libraries Community]] resources on the Web, 
where you can find:
  - Applied Informatics' general [[http://www.appinf.com/en/services/index.html Support Services]] page,
  - [[http://pocoproject.org/documentation/ introductory slides and articles]], and
  - [[http://pocoproject.org/forum/ discussion forums]] on various topics.
  
If these resources still not answer your question, there is also a <!mailing list!> named 
[[https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/poco-develop poco-develop]], read by the
maintainers of POCO. In order to defend against spam, you are required to
[[https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/poco-develop subscribe]] 
to the list before you can send a message to it.
