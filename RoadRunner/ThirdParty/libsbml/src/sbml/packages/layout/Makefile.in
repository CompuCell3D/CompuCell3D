# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration variables
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Some of the following are substituted automatically by `configure'.  If
# you are looking at "Makefile", do not edit these values; instead, run the
# configure script at the top level of the src tree.  It will recreate
# "Makefile".

include @top_srcdir@/config/makefile-common-vars.mk

# `srcdir' points to the current directory, but should be set by configure.
# `subdir' must be set manually to the relative dir under `srcdir'.  Don't 
# set `subdir' to an absolute path, or some `make' actions will fail.

srcdir    = @srcdir@
thisdir   = src/sbml/packages/layout

#
# (Warning) 
#
# The "sbml" subdir is special because it ends up linking all of
# libsbml-layout.  Anything that goes into libsbml-layout needs to appear 
# on the `subdirs' list before "sbml".
#
subdirs = common extension util sbml

# Variables `headers', `sources', `libraries', `extra_CPPFLAGS',
# `extra_CXXFLAGS', `extra_LDFLAGS' and `distfiles' are used by the default
# rules in `makefile-common-actions.mk' included at the end.

distfiles = $(sources) $(headers) Makefile.in 

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Primary build actions
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The default action is to remake everything.  Those rules which are not
# defined below are defined in makefile-common-actions.mk.  Targets of the
# form 'foo-recursive' are interpreted by the common makefile rules as meaning
# "go into every subdir and do 'make foo' in each".
