 * @class Constraint
 * @brief LibSBML implementation of SBML's %Constraint construct.
 *
 * The Constraint object class was introduced in SBML Level&nbsp;2
 * Version&nbsp;2 as a mechanism for stating the assumptions under which a
 * model is designed to operate.  The <em>constraints</em> are statements
 * about permissible values of different quantities in a model.
 * Constraints are not used to compute dynamical values for simulation or
 * analysis, but rather, they serve an advisory role for
 * simulation/analysis tools.
 *
 * SBML's Constraint object class has one required attribute, "id", to
 * give the parameter a unique identifier by which other parts of an SBML
 * model definition can refer to it.  A Constraint object can also have an
 * optional "name" attribute of type @c string.  Identifiers and names must
 * be used according to the guidelines described in the SBML specification
 * (e.g., Section 3.3 in the Level&nbsp;2 Version 4 specification).  
 *
 * Constraint has one required subelement, "math", containing a MathML
 * formula defining the condition of the constraint.  This formula must
 * return a boolean value of @c true when the model is a <em>valid</em>
 * state.  The formula can be an arbitrary expression referencing the
 * variables and other entities in an SBML model.  The evaluation of "math"
 * and behavior of constraints are described in more detail below.
 *
 * A Constraint structure also has an optional subelement called "message".
 * This can contain a message in XHTML format that may be displayed to the
 * user when the condition of the formula in the "math" subelement
 * evaluates to a value of @c false.  Software tools are not required to
 * display the message, but it is recommended that they do so as a matter
 * of best practice.  The XHTML content within a "message" subelement must
 * follow the same restrictions as for the "notes" element on SBase
 * described in in the SBML Level&nbsp;2 specification; please consult the
 * <a target="_blank" href="http://sbml.org/Documents/Specifications">SBML
 * specification document</a> corresponding to the SBML Level and Version
 * of your model for more information about the requirements for "notes"
 * content.
 *
 * Constraint was introduced in SBML Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;2.  It is
 * not available in earlier versions of Level&nbsp;2 nor in any version of
 * Level&nbsp;1.
 *
 * @section constraint-semantics Semantics of Constraints
 * 
 * In the context of a simulation, a Constraint has effect at all times
 * <em>t \f$\geq\f$ 0</em>.  Each Constraint's "math" subelement is first
 * evaluated after any InitialAssignment definitions in a model at <em>t =
 * 0</em> and can conceivably trigger at that point.  (In other words, a
 * simulation could fail a constraint immediately.)
 *
 * Constraint structures <em>cannot and should not</em> be used to compute
 * the dynamical behavior of a model as part of, for example, simulation.
 * Constraints may be used as input to non-dynamical analysis, for instance
 * by expressing flux constraints for flux balance analysis.
 *
 * The results of a simulation of a model containing a constraint are
 * invalid from any simulation time at and after a point when the function
 * given by the "math" subelement returns a value of @c false.  Invalid
 * simulation results do not make a prediction of the behavior of the
 * biochemical reaction network represented by the model.  The precise
 * behavior of simulation tools is left undefined with respect to
 * constraints.  If invalid results are detected with respect to a given
 * constraint, the "message" subelement may optionally be displayed to the
 * user.  The simulation tool may also halt the simulation or clearly
 * delimit in output data the simulation time point at which the simulation
 * results become invalid.
 *
 * SBML does not impose restrictions on duplicate Constraint definitions or
 * the order of evaluation of Constraint objects in a model.  It is
 * possible for a model to define multiple constraints all with the same
 * mathematical expression.  Since the failure of any constraint indicates
 * that the model simulation has entered an invalid state, a system is not
 * required to attempt to detect whether other constraints in the model
 * have failed once any one constraint has failed.
 *
 * <!---------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
 *
 * @class ListOfConstraints
 * @brief LibSBML implementation of SBML's %ListOfConstraints construct.
 * 
 * The various ListOf___ classes in SBML are merely containers used for
 * organizing the main components of an SBML model.  All are derived from
 * the abstract class SBase, and inherit the various attributes and
 * subelements of SBase, such as "metaid" as and "annotation".  The
 * ListOf___ classes do not add any attributes of their own.
 *
 * The relationship between the lists and the rest of an SBML model is
 * illustrated by the following (for SBML Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;4):
 *
 * @image html listof-illustration.jpg "ListOf___ elements in an SBML Model"
 * @image latex listof-illustration.jpg "ListOf___ elements in an SBML Model"
 *
 * Readers may wonder about the motivations for using the ListOf___
 * containers.  A simpler approach in XML might be to place the components
 * all directly at the top level of the model definition.  The choice made
 * in SBML is to group them within XML elements named after
 * ListOf<em>Classname</em>, in part because it helps organize the
 * components.  More importantly, the fact that the container classes are
 * derived from SBase means that software tools can add information @em about
 * the lists themselves into each list container's "annotation".
