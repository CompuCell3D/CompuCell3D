CompuCell3D Python Code User Reference Manual
=============================================

This manual is written for typical CompuCell3D model specification. Typically, CompuCell3D-based model specification
starts with a steppable, and everything branches from there. Some CompuCell3D code is written in C++ and wrapped in
Python (`cc3d.cpp`), and other code is written in Python (`cc3d.core`). Advanced usage in Python uses
`cc3d.CompuCellSetup`.
