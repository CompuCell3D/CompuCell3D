To add new settings we need to first modify _settings.sqlite database  (in player5/Configuration/Configuration_settings)
by inserting initial values of settings

Once we do that the code will pick up new settings and they will be incorporated into user's settings
to add entries (example below) to settings execute the following script in sqlite database editor for example in
DB Browser for SQLLite (nice too for cross platform database browsing)

insert into settings(name, type, value) VALUES("RestartOutputEnable","bool",0);
insert into settings(name, type, value) VALUES("RestartOutputFrequency","int",100);
insert into settings(name, type, value) VALUES("RestartAllowMultipleSnapshots","bool",0);

to delete row - example

DELETE FROM settings WHERE name='RestartEnable';
