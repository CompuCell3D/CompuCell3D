    Mixing Python versions:

    Sometimes when there are more than 1 Python version  installed on your OS CMake may mix headers and libraries from different versions of Python. In this case on cmake-gui
    check advanced chack-box and type Python in the search line. Make sure that headers, executable and libraries of Python come from the same version If they do not, change paths accordingly
