This simulation shows the typical labyrinthine type of patterns pattern formation in reaction diffusion systems using Gray-Scott model.

Expected Result: The simulations of the Gray-Scott model are expected to show intricate pattern formation depending heavily on the parameter choice.
 

The evolution of self-organizing pattern formation was introduced by Alan Turing [1] providing a detailed explanation of how reaction-diffusion systems could be responsible for the emergence of pattern formation in nature. One can see how diffusion coefficients are selected as well as how reaction functions emerge as an additional term in the XML file. Here, stripe and labyrinthine type of patterns are observed in the Compucell3D simulation. For details of parameter selection of such patterns we refer readers to the work [2]. We note that, change in any of the parameters can lead to different types of patterns. Through CompuCell3D, the simulation effectively illustrates the evolution of labyrinthine type of patterns.
