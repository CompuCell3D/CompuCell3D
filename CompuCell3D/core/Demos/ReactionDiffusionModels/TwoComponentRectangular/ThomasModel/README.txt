This simulation shows the spatiotemporal pattern formation in reaction diffusion systems using Thomas model. 

Expected Result: The simulation should exhibit pattern formation under the proper selection of system parameters.
 
Thomas kinetics, is a well-known reaction kinetics exhibiting the spatial and spatiotemporal dynamics of patterns. Originally proposed to exhibit the interaction of enzymes, reaction between uric acid, the substrate, and oxygen, the co-substrate [1].  For the parameter selection, we refer readers to the work in [2]. One can see how diffusion coefficients are selected as well as how reaction functions emerge as an additional term in the XML file. Through CompuCell3D, the simulation effectively illustrates the spatiotemporal pattern formation in Thomas model.
