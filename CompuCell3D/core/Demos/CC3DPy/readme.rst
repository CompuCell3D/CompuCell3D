CC3D Python Interface Demo Collection
======================================

This directory contains a collection of examples that demonstrate various
CC3D usage and capability with the CC3D Python interface. All demos in this
collection treat CC3D as a standalone Python module and provide various
examples of applications ranging from basic simulation development to
advanced applications like implementing interacting simulations that
execute simultaneously and share model object data.
