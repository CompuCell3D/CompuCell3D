This demo is incorrect and pending fixes. 

Bar charts (histograms) and line charts show the following fields in real-time:
1. Average volume of all cells
2. Average energy change by function
3. Accepted Effective Energy Changes
4. Rejected Effective Energy Changes

Expected result: The average volume of each cell regresses to the mean as the cells sort.
