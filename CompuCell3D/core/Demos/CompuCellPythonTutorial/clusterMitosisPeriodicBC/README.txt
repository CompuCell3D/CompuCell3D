This demonstrates the division of compartmentalized cells with periodic boundary conditions.

Expected result: A single cell with a "center" compartment" and four "side" compartments grows and divides into copies of itself. The left and right sides of the simulation show separate halves of some cells due to the boundary conditions. 

A PIFF file is used to generate the initial cell. Several mitosis modes are provided.
