This is the same as the Diffusion demo, but it includes an extra field that is quite beautiful to look at. The main (FGF) chemical field diffuses in a radial pattern. At the same time, this demo periodically creates .dat files to record the overall concentration of the field.

An initial concentration of the main chemical is created from the included text file, and then DiffusionSolverFE controls the rest.
