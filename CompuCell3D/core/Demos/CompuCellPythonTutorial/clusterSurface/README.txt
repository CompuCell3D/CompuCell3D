This demonstrates the division of compartmentalized cells that need to maintain a certain target surface.

Expected result: A single cell with a "center" compartment" and four "side" compartments grows and divides into copies of itself. Notice that the clusters generally remain intact even as the region becomes dense with cells. 

This demo also manipulates the target and lambda surface of each cluster to encourage each cluster to grow to a uniform shape. This can be done in either Python or XML. Lastly, a PIFF file is used to generate the initial cell.
