This demo shows how to create in Python multiple cells belonging to the same cluster. We demonstrate how
Contact and ContactInternal energy terms result in a desired cell morphology. We are also adding Focal Point Plasticity energy term
to enforce cell-cell separation. We also show that FPP links are not sufficient to maintain elongated cell cluster shape because
the cell cluster still can freely bend
