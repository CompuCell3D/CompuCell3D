This demo teaches some applications of the sim_service module CC3D implementation, including
    - How to interactively run a CC3D simulation service in Python using a service proxy
    - How to run CC3D simulations within a CC3D simulation as a service
    - How to define and use a service function
    - How to forward the service functions of services running within services 
    
    A simulation service behaves similarly to an interactive CC3D simulation, but with some subtle differences. When 
    instantiating a simulation service through the sim_service module, a reference to the actual simulation service is 
    not returned. Rather, a proxy to the simulation service is returned that has methods to interact with the 
    underlying simulation service, which is runnning elsewhere on a server (whether locally, or remotely). Some of the 
    methods available are demonstrated below, including interactively running a simulation and designing/employing 
    customization of a service interface through service functions. 
    
    A service function defines an internal service method that can be employed through the service interface,
    which can be accessed as an attribute on the service proxy. They can be designed into a simulation without 
    breaking the simulation when running normally (e.g., when running directly in Player), as the sim_service module 
    will detect if a simulation is being run as a service. In cases where a simulation is employed as a service, 
    service function instantiations occur. In cases where a simulation is not being employed as a serivce, service 
    function instantiations are simply ignored. 
    
    A service proxy can be instantiated using its service factory defined in the sim_service module. For CC3D, the 
    factory is service_cc3d, which takes the same arguments as those that we would pass to CC3DCaller and 
    CC3DSimService to instantiate a simulation. 
    
    When running services within services, the service functions of a child service can be mapped onto the proxy of 
    the parent service by simply declaring the service functions of the child service as service functions of the parent 
    service in the typical way.
