This divides the cell into 4 quadrants to demonstrate the effect of temperature (fluctuation amplitude) on cell membrane activity. 

The Python code selects the top-left quadrant of the cell blob and assigns a high fluctuation amplitude to them. After a moment, it sets the value back to -1 and selects the next quadrant in a clockwise manner. 

The property can be set using either FluctuationAmplitude or Temperature in XML or fluctuation_amplitude in Python.
