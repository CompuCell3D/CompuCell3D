Here, Glucose bolsters cell growth and proliferation but also enables us to model cell death when it is absent. This model is in 3D and can show 3 chemical fields. We recommend the 'xz' camera perspective for a top-down view. 

Expected result: A large amount of Glucose is placed into the medium during initialization because of the attached .dat file. Later, this Glucose will be consumed by the cancer cells. By the end, VEGF1 has a high concentration somewhere in the medium, somewhat far away from the cell blob. VEGF2, conversely, is high in the cell blob because it is secreted by Proliferating-type cells, although its diffusion is limited by uptake from Vascular and NeoVascular cells. 

See the included VascularTumor.xml file for more details about the calculations.
